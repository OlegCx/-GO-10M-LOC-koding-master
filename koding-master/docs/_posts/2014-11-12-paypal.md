A standard credit card may not always be the most handy option for those of you who transact online using alternative payment methods. Moreover, with a growing number of theft of credit card data, alternative payment methods are more desirable. <!--more--> We want Koding's full resources to be available to everyone globally and that is why today we are excited to bring you the option to pay using [PayPal][2].

This was a_ most requested_ feature from the Koding community and so we hope that a lot of you will now be able to enjoy the full Koding experience and at the same time feel secure that your payment information is protected by the solid walls of PayPal.

Getting started with Paypal on Koding is easy. Simply visit the [Koding Pricing Page][3], select your plan and then select the option to checkout using Paypal. Simple!

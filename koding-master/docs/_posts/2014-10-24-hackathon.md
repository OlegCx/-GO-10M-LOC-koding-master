Hackathons are awesome, they allow creative teams to solve problems in a very short amount of time. However, the challenge with traditional hackathons is that they require you to be physically present in a room. With more and more of our lives moving online, why be tied to a location in order to solve problems?

Today we change that, announcing the World's First Global Virtual Hackathon... location not required!

We have an awesome line up of judges and great prizes. This is going to be fun...so mark your calendars and apply to become a part of this unique event.

**Registration opens Monday, Oct 27th, 2014 at 10:00AM PDT. [Watch this space][2]!**

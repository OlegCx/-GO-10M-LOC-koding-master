Hi Everyone,

We recently ran an ad that many were offended by. Our sincere apologies: we will stop that ad now. It was not our intention to cause offense, and we don't want to be remotely associated with sexism.
<!--more-->

We will use other ones and make sure we're always male/female/straight/lgbt friendly. Since we love all, we'd never, ever make any distinction in any way.

Just to prove our intention, another one from the same series:

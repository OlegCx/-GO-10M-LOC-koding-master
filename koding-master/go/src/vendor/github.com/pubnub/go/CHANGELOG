NETWORKING BEHAVIOUR CHANGED
- Add request workers for different request types. Each Pubnub instance has
  it's own request workers set now. Each worker has it's own transport, which
  now can be customized by user using associated setter.
  Previously, transports were shared between multiple instances. A key bug was
  that when SDK were acting with net.Conns, sometimes references to it were
  pointing to the non-actual net.Conn in http.Transport's pool.

FEATURES
- Add module setters for default subscribe and non-subscribe transports
- Add instance setters for subscribe and non-subscribe transports
- Add more errors handling codecoverage for codecov.io
- Rewrite most of loggers with unified syntax

BREAKING CHANGES
- Add history 'include_token' param
- Add uuid param to state getter
- Add channelGroup param to HereNow method
- Channel group's add and remove methods errors channel now emits a single error
  with a group as entity, instead of multiple errors with all passed-in channels
  as entity
